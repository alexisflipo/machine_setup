# SETUP

## Overview

When we get a new machine often we need to configure it to be operational. Configuring a computer is often tedious and time consuming. This repo aims to help the installation of some tools and facilitate the configuration of a new machine for a Dev Ops /Data (Ops) Engineer oriented position. 

> **_DISCLAIMER:_** This documentation is a helping guideline. Some of these configurations may not work on your working station so please make sure to read the official documentation if it is not the case. 

> :warning: This tutorial only support Mac OS intel configuration. GNU/Linux based os and Mac OS Apple Sillicon will be covered later.
